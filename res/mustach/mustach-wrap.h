/**
 * mustach_wrap_itf - high level wrap of mustach - interface for callbacks
 *
 * The functions sel, subsel, enter and next should return 0 or 1.
 *
 * All other functions should normally return MUSTACH_OK (zero).
 *
 * If any function returns a negative value, it means an error that
 * stop the processing and that is reported to the caller. Mustach
 * also has its own error codes. Using the macros MUSTACH_ERROR_USER
 * and MUSTACH_IS_ERROR_USER could help to avoid clashes.
 *
 * @start: If defined (can be NULL), starts the mustach processing
 *         of the closure, called at the very beginning before any
 *         mustach processing occurs.
 *
 * @stop: If defined (can be NULL), stops the mustach processing
 *        of the closure, called at the very end after all mustach
 *        processing occurered. The status returned by the processing
 *        is passed to the stop.
 *
 * @compare: If defined (can be NULL), compares the value of the
 *           currently selected item with the given value and returns
 *           a negative value if current value is lesser, a positive
 *           value if the current value is greater or zero when
 *           values are equals.
 *           If 'compare' is NULL, any comparison in mustach
 *           is going to fails.
 *
 * @sel: Selects the item of the given 'name'. If 'name' is NULL
 *       Selects the current item. Returns 1 if the selection is
 *       effective or else 0 if the selection failed.
 *
 * @subsel: Selects from the currently selected object the value of
 *          the field of given name. Returns 1 if the selection is
 *          effective or else 0 if the selection failed.
 *
 * @enter: Enters the section of 'name' if possible.
 *         Musts return 1 if entered or 0 if not entered.
 *         When 1 is returned, the function 'leave' will always be called.
 *         Conversely 'leave' is never called when enter returns 0 or
 *         a negative value.
 *         When 1 is returned, the function must activate the first
 *         item of the section.
 *
 * @next: Activates the next item of the section if it exists.
 *        Musts return 1 when the next item is activated.
 *        Musts return 0 when there is no item to activate.
 *
 * @leave: Leaves the last entered section
 *
 * @get: If defined (can be NULL), returns in 'sbuf' the value of 'name'.
 *       As an extension (see NO_ALLOW_EMPTY_TAG), the 'name' can be
 *       the empty string. In that later case an implementation can
 *       return MUSTACH_ERROR_EMPTY_TAG to refuse empty names.
 *       If 'get' is NULL and 'put' NULL the error MUSTACH_ERROR_INVALID_ITF
 *       is returned.
